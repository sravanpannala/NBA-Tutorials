# NBA Analytics Tutorials by Sravan

- This repo will contain the tutorials related to NBA data scraping, processing, analysis and visualization.
- Most of the tutorials here will be refined versions of code in my [NBA Projects repo](https://github.com/sravanpannala/NBA). The setup required for that repo is hard and can prevent many people from coding and running the code.
- So, I'm creating this repo separately. The setup required should be easy and the code will be also be written in a way which will be easy to follow and run on your own. 
- Inspired by [Owen Phillips](https://twitter.com/owenlhjphillips) [The F5](https://thef5.substack.com/) the tutorials will have a companion piece on my [blog](https://blog.sradjoker.cc)
- These tutorials are also inspired by NBA tutorials by [Ryan Davis](https://github.com/rd11490/NBA_Tutorials) and [Andrew Patton](https://github.com/anpatton/basic-nba-tutorials)
- Reach out to me on Twitter at [@SravanNBA](https://twitter.com/SravanNBA) if you have any questions/comments/concerns

# Setup
- The code in this repo is written in Python or iPython (jupyter) notebooks. You need python to run the code.
- You can install the packages required by this repo using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). 
- After installing poetry, just run in this folder
```
poetry install
```
- This command will install all the packages used to run the different codes in this repo in a new virtual environment.
- You can use the newly generated virtual environment as the kernel for the notebooks in this repo.
